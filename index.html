        <h2>Your website is your business</h2>
        <p>A businessâ€™s online presence, regardless of industry, can have a massive impact on its success. In this day and age, some businesses still donâ€™t realize that a majority of their customers will visit their website before making a purchase. Having a strong online presence, particularly a website, can be make or break for generating more revenue.</p>

That is why it's my focus to help my own local businesses and small buinesses around the country.</p>
